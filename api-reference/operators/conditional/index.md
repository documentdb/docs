# Conditional Expression Operators

Conditional expression operators provide ways to define conditional logic in queries and aggregation pipelines. These operators allow you to perform different operations based on specified conditions.

## Operators

- [$cond](cond.md) - A ternary operator that evaluates a boolean expression and returns one of two specified values
- [$ifNull](ifnull.md) - Returns either the non-null result of the first expression or the result of the second expression
- [$switch](switch.md) - Evaluates a series of case expressions and returns a matching result
