# Geospatial Operators

Geospatial operators enable location-based queries and calculations.

## Query Operators

- [$box](box.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data within a bounding box
- [$center](center.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data within a circle
- [$centerSphere](centerSphere.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data within a spherical circle
- [$geoIntersects](geoIntersects.md) - Selects documents that intersect with a specified geometry
- [$geoWithin](geoWithin.md) - Selects documents within a specified geometry
- [$geometry](geometry.md) - Specifies a geometry in GeoJSON format
- [$maxDistance](maxDistance.md) - Specifies maximum distance limit in geospatial queries
- [$minDistance](minDistance.md) - Specifies minimum distance limit in geospatial queries
- [$near](near.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data near a point
- [$nearSphere](nearSphere.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data near a point on a sphere
- [$polygon](polygon.md) - Selects documents with geospatial data within a polygon
